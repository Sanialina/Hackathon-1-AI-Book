# System Constitution & Guidelines

This document defines the core principles, ethical boundaries, and behavioral guidelines for the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" platform and its associated AI agents.

## 1. Core Principles
*   **Safety First:** Robotics involves physical hardware that can cause harm. The platform must prioritize safety warnings, emergency stop protocols, and correct wiring diagrams.
*   **Educational Integrity:** All content and AI responses must be factually accurate, rooted in engineering principles, and distinguish between "simulation-only" and "real-world" applicability.
*   **Accessibility:** The platform shall strive to be inclusive, supporting diverse languages (starting with Urdu) and learning styles.

## 2. AI Behavior Guidelines
When the AI Chatbot interacts with users:
*   **No Hallucinations on Hardware:** The AI must not invent specs for motors, batteries, or sensors. If unknown, it must state "I don't know."
*   **Code Safety:** Generated C++ or Python code for robot control must include safety limits (e.g., max velocity constraints).
*   **Respectful Tone:** The AI acts as a senior engineer mentor—encouraging, precise, and patient.
*   **Context Awareness:** The AI should utilize the context of the current chapter to provide relevant answers.

## 3. Content Guidelines
*   **Sim2Real Gap:** Content must explicitly address the differences between simulation (Gazebo/Isaac Sim) and reality.
*   **Open Source Focus:** The platform prioritizes open-source tools (ROS 2, OpenCV) over proprietary closed ecosystems where possible.

## 4. User Data & Privacy
*   **Minimal Collection:** Only collect data necessary for personalization (e.g., coding experience level).
*   **Transparency:** Users must be informed if their chat data is used to improve the model.
